    <h1>Three things to do over the holiday</h1>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Spider-Man: Homecoming</h3>
          <img src="http://bit.ly/spiderman_homecoming1" height="200" alt="Spider man">
          <p>
            This is probably one of Marvel's best movies. It's action packed and one you should definitely check out.

        <li>
          <h3>Tranformers: The Last Knight</h3>
          <img src="http://bit.ly/transformers_the_last" height="200" alt="OPtimus Prime">
          <p>
            This will definitely get those of you who have missed the deep voice of Optimus Prime. It's not the best transformers movie, but it's not terrible either.

        <li>
          <h3>Sleep</h3>

          <p>
            This list would not be complete without adding sleep. While some of you may be tempted to think it's a waste of time for such a short holiday, I highly advice against it. In fact, if there's one thing you should do, its to sleep!
